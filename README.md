# Advent of Code

Holiday fun with a bit of code! Help save Christmas by solving some pesky problems!

This repository contains _my_ solutions to the Advent challenges, but they are not guaranteed to be the _best_ solutions (efficient, DRY, or otherwise). It's best to solve the puzzles on your own and then compare for kicks!

Get started while you still can, and good luck!
