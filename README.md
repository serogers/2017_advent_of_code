# Advent of Code

Holiday fun with a bit of code! Help save Christmas by solving some pesky problems!

[AdventOfCode.com](http://adventofcode.com) presents 25 unique coding challenges during the holiday season. It's tons of fun and I suggest anyone who is interested in math, word problems, or programing to give it a shot!

This repository contains _my_ solutions to the challenges presented by [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com). They are not guaranteed to be the _best_ solutions; efficient, [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), or otherwise. It's best to solve the puzzles on your own and then compare for kicks!

Get started while you still can, and good luck!

I'm not the creator of Advent of Code, but I do enjoy participating! I've posted these solutions for educational purposes. To prevent spoiling the leaderboard, I only post solutions to past challenges (not the current day) and exclude the official puzzle input data.
